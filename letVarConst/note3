Throttle vs Debounce in JavaScript

## 🚀 Overview
When users perform actions like scrolling, typing, or clicking, events fire repeatedly at high speed.  
To optimize performance and prevent unnecessary function calls, JavaScript uses:

- **Throttle**
- **Debounce**

Both help control how often a function runs, but they work differently.

# ⚡ Throttle

### ✅ What is Throttle?
Throttle ensures a function executes **at most once** in a given time interval, no matter how many times an event is fired.

### 🎯 Example Use Cases
- Scroll event
- Resize event
- Button click spam prevention
- API rate limiting

### 📌 Key Idea
**Run the function every X milliseconds.**  
If events keep firing, throttle **limits** how often the function runs.


### Debounce
Debounce delays the function call until the user stops performing the action for a specific amount of time.

🎯 Example Use Cases

Search input typing (API call)

Auto-save feature

Form validation

Filtering / Searching

📌 Key Idea

Run the function only after the user stops.
